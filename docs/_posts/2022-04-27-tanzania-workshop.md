From 16th – 25th March 2022, [SEOSAW](https://seosaw.github.io/) in collaboration with Global Grassy Group and [Miombo Network](http://miombonetwork.org/) organized a training workshop on herbaceous data collection protocol at Kitulangalo forest reserve in Morogoro, Tanzania.

The activities consisted of herbaceous composition, shrubs and tree sampling. Additionally, vouchering and plant pressing was also included in the training.
