Although we tend to have a better understanding of the response of stand disturbances towards tree growth and development, little is known about how human disturbances and management can influence the diversity and species richness of the ground-layer plant communities in Miombo ecosystems. Although the ground-layer plant communities are often ignored in management practices, they are key to thriving pollinator assemblages and foraging resources during the rest of the year when the Miombo sheds its leaves. They also offer grazing resources for cattle and livestock, as well as other bee products for communitiesâ€™ livelihoods and conservation. Inadequate or improper protocols for measuring diversity in ground-layer communities can limit planning and management for improved productivity.

We introduced the Global Grassland Group Protocol for measuring ground-layer herbaceous diversity in the Tanzanian Miombo in 2022. We collected data from 12 long-term sites in two stands with historical silvicultural treatments (plot fencing, thinning, and soil tilling) and other stand disturbances on the ground layer diversity at the Kitulangh'alo Miombo study plots in Morogoro, Tanzania. We hypothesised that fencing would eliminate the grazing; while thinning and soil tilling would enhance diversity and seed germination. Maintaining optimal values in stocking parameters is crucial in enhancing ground-layer species diversity, which is of paramount importance to pollinators-services offered by the ground-layer species, such as honey bees, for thriving honey production in Miombo woodlands.
