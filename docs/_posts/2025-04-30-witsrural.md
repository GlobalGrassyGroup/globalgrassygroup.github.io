Many semi-arid savannas are plagued by bush encroachment which limits grazing capacity and degrades ecosystem processes. Land owners struggle to get support for bush clearing programs as they contradict the narrative that restoration projects should concurrently store carbon.

[Future Ecosystems For Africa](https://futureecosystemsafrica.org/) has teamed up with [ReWild Capital](https://www.rewildcapital.com/) to test a method of bush clearing that would convert the cleared biomass into biochar: a stable form of carbon. We are trialling a project at the Wits Rural Facility, an area that has not burned since 1998, to investigate whether the carbon credits from the biochar can fund the bush clearing, and therefore prove a feasible option for managing bush encroachment at large scales.

To assess the biodiversity and species composition of the encroached sites, and test how this recovers when the clearing treatments have been put in, two different habitats were sampled as encroached vs clear. We used the Global Grassy Group protocol to record the diversity of ground-layer plants at four plots per habitat.

The surveys recorded 127 species distributed in 32 families and 86 genera. The most common families were Fabaceae (26 species, 13 genera), Poaceae (21 species, 17 genera), Malvaceae (9 species, 8 genera), Convolvulaceae (7 species, 4 genera), Asteraceae (6 species, 4 genera) and Rubiaceae (4 species, 4 genera).

Considering functional groups, forbs (non-leguminous) dominate with 55 species, equivalent to 44%, followed by woody species (most of them in the regeneration phase) with 35 species (27.5%), grasses with 21 species (16.5%) and legume forbs with 15 species (12%).

Although no visible signs of human disturbance were found, 4 introduced species were recorded, namely *Lantana camara*, *Bidens* sp., *Abelmoschus* sp. and *Tagetes minuta* (which can be considered invasive).

Fieldwork was led by researchers from Wits University, SAN Parks Scientific Services and Instituto Superior Politecnico Tundavala (Angola). We express our thanks to Twine Wayne (Wits University), Mukhumo Shedron (MalaMala Game Reserve), Mashele Mightman, Masango Elijah (both from South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)) and Corli Wigley-Coetsee (SANParks Scientific Services) for joining us during the surveys.
