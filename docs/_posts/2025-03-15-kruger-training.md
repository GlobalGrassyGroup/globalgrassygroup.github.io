We spent two weeks in Kruger National Park learning lots at the 22nd Savanna Science Network Meeting, watching incredible wildlife and collecting data on the experimental burn plots.

As a method for sampling species composition and some ecological characteristics, we introduced the Global Grassy Group protocol to colleagues from the South African National Parks Scientific Services Department for their long-term vegetation monitoring.  

Around 150 plant species were recorded so far across four fire regimes, for which we used the Skukuza herbarium to check the names of our pressed specimens.

We plan to carry out training on sampling ground-layer diversity again in Kruger next March, so do reach out if you are interested in joining us for some fun science and plenty of grasses!
