Itâ€™s the end of the dry season. The landscape at Mutinondo Wilderness is in limbo as it awaits the first rains. From towering granite inselbergs, you can look out across the mosaic of Miombo woodland flushing new red leaves and seasonal dambo wetlands that are golden with dense dry grasses. Patches of blackened fire scars already show green signs of regrowth.
