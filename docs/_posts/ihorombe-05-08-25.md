Twenty kilograms of newspaper, four plant presses, hand lenses, measuring tapes, sharpened pencils, printed site maps and anoraks. Not to mention enough vary (rice) to support an energetic team of biologists, local guides, drivers and *gendarme* (local guards) for two weeks. We were prepared.

We set off from the Kew Madagascar offices in Antananarivo in late February 2025, the tail end of rainy season, with three off road vehicles and high hopes of reaching the so-called Lost Forest of Ivohiboro in the southern reaches of Madagascar’s extensive escarpment. Not for the remarkable humid forests, but rather to sample the surrounding grasslands and savannas around the isolated mountain massif. These surrounding open grassy ecosystems are often described as a desert or barren landscape, justifying targeting these habitats for forest restoration in the form of tree-planting. Yet, these grassland-forest mosaics are typical of Madagascar’s Central Highlands and starkly represent the current conservation narrative in this region: plant trees, restore and protect the unique forest biodiversity and keep the frequent grassland fires at bay. 

However, decades of research continue to bring to light the unique nature of these Malagasy grassy ecosystems. They are not barren. Many of the open grassy flora arrived voluntarily on the island millions of years ago, over half of the grass and over a third of the sedge species are endemic, and many fire-adapted forbs and trees are found only in these habitats. Still, much remains unknown. Vast regions of Madagascar’s plants, both light- and shade-loving species, remain under- or un-sampled. So where does this grassland biodiversity sit? What functionally distinct types of grassland-savannas do we find? Where are the most optimal sites for grassland conservation, livestock grazing and tree planting? And how can we best understand and manage the ancient interaction between grasslands, forests and fire?
