We organised Global Grassy Group (GGG) field training as part of the first Tropical East Asian Savanna Symposium, held from 23rd to 29th June 2025 at the University of Edinburgh. The event brought together scientists from around the world who work on the largely understudied savanna ecosystems of East Asia. 

During the training, we introduced the GGG framework and discussed how it could be applied to East Asian savannas. We also spent time in the field, using a Scottish grassland ecosystem as a practical example to explore vegetation structure and species composition. It was a great opportunity to connect, share ideas, and think about how to better study and support these unique grassy ecosystems.
