# 1. Fieldwork

### Preparing for fieldwork
Some steps to take before embarking on fieldwork: 

1. Ensure you have correct permissions and permits to collect data and plants
2. Familiarise yourself with the [GGG protocol](https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/article/pex-1905/v1)
3. Download and print GGG datasheets for recording data - [contact us](/pages/contact/) to request the files
4. Gather items on the [equipment list](pages/protocol_pages/equipment/

### During fieldwork

While you are in the field, follow the data collection methods outlined in the GGG protocol as best as possible so that data are comparable.
